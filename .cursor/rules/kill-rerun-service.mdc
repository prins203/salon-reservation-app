Whenever I run a Node.js or Python application, please ensure the following steps are always followed:

---

### üîÅ 1. **Kill any app running on the expected port before rerunning**
- Before starting the app, check if the target port (e.g., 3000 for Node, 8000 for Python) is already in use.
- If it is, automatically **kill the process** using that port.
  - On macOS/Linux: `lsof -ti:<PORT> | xargs kill -9`
  - On Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :<PORT>` followed by `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`

---

### üì¶ 2. **Install dependencies when they're added**
- If any dependencies are added or modified in:
  - `package.json` (Node.js)
  - `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` (Python)
- Automatically run:
  - `npm install` or `yarn install` (Node)
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install .` (Python)
- This avoids module-not-found errors due to uninstalled packages.

---

### üìÅ 3. **Run the app from the correct project root**
- Always detect and run the app from the **correct directory**, typically where:
  - The `package.json` (for Node) or
  - `requirements.txt` / `main.py` (for Python) is located.
- Never run the app from a parent or sibling folder that doesn‚Äôt contain the environment or entry file.
- If not already in the right folder, **navigate to it automatically** before executing the command.

---

Make this the default behavior for all future runs unless I specifically override it.
