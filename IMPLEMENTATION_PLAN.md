# Salon Reservation App Improvement Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for optimizing, restructuring, and modularizing the salon reservation application. Each item has a checkbox that can be marked when completed.

## Frontend Improvements

### State Management Optimization
- [x] Implement Redux or Context API for global state management
- [x] Extract complex state logic into custom hooks
- [x] Optimize caching mechanism for appointment data
- [x] Implement proper loading states for async operations

### Component Modularization
- [x] Refactor `HairArtistDashboard.jsx` into smaller components:
  - [x] Create separate `CalendarView` component
  - [x] Extract `AppointmentDetails` dialog component
  - [ ] Create reusable `TimeSlotPicker` component
- [x] Create shared UI component library:
  - [ ] Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
  - [x] Button variants
  - [x] Form components
  - [x] Loading indicators

### API Services Reorganization
- [x] Implement service abstraction layer
- [x] Add request/response interceptors
- [x] Add proper error handling and retry logic
- [x] Group API calls into domain-specific services:
  - [x] Booking service
  - [x] Authentication service
  - [x] Hair artist service
  - [x] Service management

### Authentication Improvements
- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism
- [x] Add proper token expiration handling
- [ ] Move token storage to HTTP-only cookies
- [ ] Add role-based authorization
- [x] Implement proper logout mechanism (clearing all tokens/data)

## Backend Improvements

### Code Organization
- [ ] Modularize the `booking.py` router:
  - [ ] Move booking logic to a service layer
  - [ ] Move slot availability calculations to utility functions
  - [ ] Create separate modules for OTP handling
- [ ] Reorganize dependencies with proper injection patterns
- [ ] Create middleware for common operations
- [ ] Separate business logic from data access layer

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Add proper indexes for frequently queried fields:
  - [ ] Booking date and time
  - [ ] Hair artist ID
  - [ ] Status fields
- [ ] Implement query optimization for booking lookups
- [ ] Add database connection pooling for production
- [ ] Consider data migration strategy for schema changes

### Error Handling
- [ ] Create centralized error handling middleware
- [ ] Standardize error response format
- [ ] Add detailed logging for debugging
- [ ] Implement custom exception classes for domain-specific errors

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Move SECRET_KEY to environment variables
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Enable CORS with proper configuration
- [ ] Add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

## Performance Optimizations

### Frontend Performance
- [ ] Implement `React.memo` for pure components
- [ ] Add virtualization for long lists of appointments
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for routes
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### API Efficiency
- [ ] Implement pagination for large data sets
- [ ] Add filtering capabilities to appointment APIs
- [ ] Optimize the date range fetching logic
- [ ] Consider GraphQL for more efficient data fetching
- [ ] Implement caching strategies for API responses

### Caching Strategy
- [ ] Implement proper HTTP caching headers
- [ ] Consider service workers for offline capability
- [ ] Add Redis or similar for backend caching
- [ ] Implement entity-based cache invalidation strategy

## Architecture Improvements

### Project Structure
- [ ] Reorganize project with feature-based architecture
- [ ] Standardize folder structure:
  - [ ] Frontend structure
  - [ ] Backend structure
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Implement consistent naming conventions

### Testing Framework
- [ ] Add unit tests:
  - [ ] Frontend component tests
  - [ ] Backend logic tests
- [ ] Implement integration tests:
  - [ ] API endpoint testing
  - [ ] Database integration testing
- [ ] Add end-to-end testing for critical flows
- [ ] Set up testing pipeline

### Deployment Optimization
- [ ] Containerize the application with Docker
- [ ] Create multi-stage Docker builds
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement environment-specific configuration
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting

## Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Optimize UI for mobile screens
- [ ] Implement responsive design for all components
- [ ] Test thoroughly on various devices
- [ ] Add touch-friendly interactions

## User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Improve form validations
- [ ] Add meaningful error messages
- [ ] Implement guided flows for complex operations
- [ ] Enhance dashboard visualizations
- [ ] Add better notification system

## DevOps & Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Implement proper logging infrastructure
- [ ] Add application health checks
- [ ] Create deployment rollback strategy
- [ ] Document infrastructure setup

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor inconsistent code patterns
- [ ] Update outdated dependencies
- [ ] Remove unused code and dependencies
- [ ] Fix identified bugs from the previous memory
  - [ ] Parameter mismatch in authentication flow
  - [ ] OTP verification process
  - [ ] bcrypt dependency issues
